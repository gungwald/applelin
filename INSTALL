Linapple - crossplatfom emulator of Apple][ (Apple2, Apple 2) series computer for Linux or other OSes with SDL support.


[INSTALL]

You need SDL, cURL, zlib and libzip:

For Debian/Ubuntu their names are:

libsdl1.2-dev 	- Simple Direct Media crossplatform library for video,audio, events etc.
libcurl4		- openssl-dev -  cURL net functions
zlib1g-dev 		- access .gz files
libzip-dev 		- access .zip files

All these libraries are available for free around the world.

For example for Debian/Ubuntu to install:

$sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev zlib1g-dev libzip-dev


After being SDL, zlib, cURL and libzip installed you will be able to compile linapple from sources:

Untar the package (in .bz2 format):

$ tar xjf linapple-src_2a.tar.bz2


Then go to src directory and compile.

$ cd linapple-src_2a/src

$ make

If there was no errors, you may install it if you wish:

$ sudo make install

It will be install in /usr/local/linapple folder, whre you can find linapple.conf file for changing some linapple settings,
and empty `images` and `ftp` folders, where Apple 2 images files and downloaded through FTP images are meant to be in. 

But of course you are free to choose any directories of your choice. 
Note: you should read/write permissions of these folders, or linapple could not work properly.

For linaaple ability to unpack .zip and .gz files on the fly (either from local disks or from FTP) you also need read/write access for linapple working
folder (which by default is /usr/local/linapple), for linapple unpacks these files as drive0.dsk and drive1.dsk for drive 1 and 2 respectively.


OK.
If you installed it, you are able to run emulator from any place, just run it like this:

$ linapple


If you have chosen not to install it, go to the upper directory then and run the beast:

$ cd ..

$ ./linapple


If all files are on their places, you should see an X-Window with splash screen. 
Press F2 (or F3 before to choose some disk image in drive 1), and go to work.

Note: linapple needs some files in its current working directory for proper working.

These files are:

splash.bmp 			- splash screen
charset40.bmp		- charset for Apple][ (Apple 2e, etc.) text modes.
font.bmp			- font for Help screen and Disk Select screens.
icon.bmp			- nice icon, logo of Apple][ computer.
linapple.conf		- configuration file.
Master.dsk			- disk image with Applesoft(tm) DOS 3.3 inside. See Apple license (on apple.com) for details.

Essentials are font.bmp and charset40.bmp, others can be omitted peacefully.

P.S. You may play with some options in Makefile in src directory, if you know what you are to do. :)

Note: See README file for more detailed instructions on using linapple.


[UNINSTALL]

To uninstall previously installed linapple (by `sudo make install` command) you may write this:

$ sudo make uninstall

This will remove by default entire `/usr/local/linapple` folder and `/usr/local/bin/linapple` script.


Also there is possible command for cleaning compiled binaries in src directory:

$ make clean

Note: `linapple` executable in upper directory will remain intact.
